    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>the goal of this website is to offer a place where players of D&D and other tabletop games
    can have an online database to input their notes so they are easily shared with the other players of the group.
    Only the members of a campaign will be able to see the notes for it, and the creator of a campaign will be able
    to invite others to join.</p>
